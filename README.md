***This notebook is for Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/choose-tutors.***
In this competition the task is to predict the probability for a tutor to be a proper one for preparing for the math exam. Two datasets are given: train.csv (contains all features and the target) and test.csv (only features).
The evaluation metric is ROC AUC.
Data files can be downloaded from competition's page.

The main idea of the competition is the use of self-made ML algorithms. I implemented the following models:
* decision tree;
* logistic regression;
* random forest;
* adaboost on logistic regression.
The best score was given by adaboost model.
